Polymorphism is an ability of an object to take many different forms

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Parent obj = new Child();
Person p1 = new Employee();

Interface obj = new ConcreteClass();
BrowserAutomation obj = new ChromeAutomation();

ReferenceType ref = new ActualObject();

ReferenceType will decide what properties and method
available for ref.

If actual object class will override some methods from Reference type
when calling these method, the overridden method will be invoked.
We call this runtime polymorphism.
