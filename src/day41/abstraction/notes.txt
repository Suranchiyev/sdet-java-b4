Abstraction lets us focus on what object does instead of how it does
by using abstract methods. 
- Both abstract class and interface cannot initialize directly.
- Both abstract class and interface have abstract methods without body.
- First concrete class that will extends/implements must implement(Override)
  all abstract methods.
  
 Inteface vs Abstract class
 - Abstract class can have regular methods and properties but
   interface can have only abstract method except default and static
 - We can extend only one abstract class at time but we can implmenet
   multiple interfaces.
 - extends keyword for abstraction
   implements keyword for interface
