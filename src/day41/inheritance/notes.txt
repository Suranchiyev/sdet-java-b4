Inheritance is one the OOP concepts in Java. Where one class can inherit visible
properties/methods of another class. Parent(super) child(base class) relationship 
between classes.

Why do we need to use inheritance?
To reuse the code.

java.lang.Object class is super class of every class in java.

What's method overriding?
Method overriding is when child class overrides the methods of parent class.
- method signatures should same(name, return type, arguments)
- child class method should have same access modifier or more visible
- if parent class method throws exception then child class can throw same exception
  or throw smaller exception(or no exception at all).


Overloading vs Overriding? 
	- Overloading will take a place in the same class where methods have same name
	  but different arguments(type, number of args, order)
	- Overriding when child class overrides parent class methods.  


Java is single-inherited language. We can inherit one class at time.
// Student extends Person, Employee
Why java is allowing only single inheritance? There is diamond problem. 
They solve this problem by using interface by letting to implement multiple 
interfaces at the same time.
