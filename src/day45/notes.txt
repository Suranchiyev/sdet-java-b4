	1. What type of exceptions do you know in Java?
	   Runtime, Checked, Error	
	2. What's the difference between runtime and checked exceptions?
       Runtime exceptions are not require to hanlde.
       Checked exceptions we must handle or decare it.
	3. What's error in java?
  	   Errors handled by JVM, and we don't throw the error and never 
  	   handle them.
	4. How do you handle an exception in Java?
 	   We hanlde exceptions in java by using try catch statement
 	   try {
 	   	  // code that might throw exception
 	   } catch (TypeOfException e) {
 	   	  // code to handle it.
 	   }
	5. Can we have multiple catch blocks in try catch statement?
	   Yes, we can. The smaller(more specific) exception type should go first.
	6. What does finally block do?
	   finally block always executed. Usually we close resources and do some clean up.	
	7. What's exception declaration?
	   Exception declaration when we put 'throws' in the method declaration. If code inside the method throw/throws you can delcare it and the client code that will use your method should handle it or decare it as well.
	   public void print(int i) throws Exception {
	   		if (i % 2 == 0) {
	   			throw new Exception();
	   		}
	   		System.out.println(i);
	   }
	   ---
	   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
	   		print(5);
			print(2); // Exception
	   }
